# smart Parking System

Once upon a time, in a bustling city, there was a man named Rahul. He was a diligent businessman who owned and managed a grand shopping mall. The mall attracted numerous visitors every day, and Rahul took great pride in providing them with the best shopping experience.

However, there was one challenge that Rahul faced - the parking lot. The parking lot at the mall would fluctuate between being empty and crowded at different times of the day. Despite this, the lights in the parking area remained on 24/7, resulting in an exorbitant electricity bill that amounted to around 30,000 each month.

Realizing the need to minimize costs, Rahul decided to seek the expertise of a skilled software engineer named Abdul. Abdul was known for his innovative ideas and technical prowess. Rahul knew that with Abdul's help, he could find a solution to reduce the electricity bill while maintaining the mall's excellent service.

Excited about the opportunity, Abdul eagerly accepted the challenge. He meticulously studied the parking lot's patterns and analyzed the electricity consumption data. After careful consideration, Abdul came up with a brilliant idea - he proposed the development of an Internet of Things (IoT) device.

Abdul's IoT device would be strategically placed throughout the parking lot, equipped with advanced sensors and intelligent software algorithms. The purpose of the device was to detect the presence of vehicles and people in the parking area. If the device determined that there were no vehicles or people present, it would automatically turn off the lights, thereby conserving electricity.

Rahul was intrigued by Abdul's solution and immediately approved the implementation of the IoT device. The device was installed throughout the parking lot, seamlessly integrating with the existing infrastructure.

As days went by, the IoT device proved to be a tremendous success. It accurately detected the presence or absence of vehicles and people, and the lights in the parking area responded accordingly. Whenever the parking lot was empty, the lights would dim or turn off entirely, saving a significant amount of electricity.

With the IoT device in place, Rahul noticed a remarkable change in the mall's electricity bill. The cost of electricity was reduced by approximately 25%, saving around 7,000 each month. Rahul was elated not only by the cost savings but also by the mall's commitment to environmental sustainability.

News of Rahul's innovative approach and Abdul's technological brilliance spread throughout the city. Other businesses and establishments were inspired by their success and started implementing similar energy-saving strategies in their respective locations.

Rahul and Abdul's collaboration not only brought financial benefits to the mall but also set an example for the community. Their story serves as a reminder that with ingenuity and a drive for positive change, even the most challenging problems can be solved. Together, they proved that innovation and technology can go hand in hand with sustainability, creating a brighter and greener future for all.
